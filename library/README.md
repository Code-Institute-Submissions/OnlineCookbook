I used Materialize to style my website. Below is the code I used, before I edited it to suit my needs and added custom CSS.

* The *'dropdownmenu.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/navbar.html), titled 'Navbar Dropdown Menu', and is used on *'base.html'*.

* The *'mobilecollapsemenu.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/navbar.html), titled 'Mobile Collapse Menu', and is used on *'base.html'*.

* The *'formselect.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/select.html), titled 'Select', and is used on *'add_recipe.html'* and *'edit_recipe.html'*.

* The *'radiobutton.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/radio-buttons.html), titled 'Radio Button', and is used on *'add_recipe.html'* and *'edit_recipe.html'*.

* The *'buttons.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html), titled 'Raised', and are used on most pages across the app.

* The *'forms.html'* is from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html), titled 'Input Fields' and 'Icon Prefixes', and are used on  *'add_recipe.html'*, *'edit_recipe.html'*, *'add_author.html'* and *'add_cuisine.html'*.
